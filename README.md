# MinecraftServerTelegram
Do you want a cool telegram bot that displays your server status and acts as a console? Then this is the place for you!

1. Install Python (https://www.python.org)
2. Move the file to your server folder
3. Before running the file, install telebot (pip install telebot)
4. Open the start.py file with any editor and insert your values, carefully reading what I wrote in the notes (via #)
5. Open the terminal and type the following commands:

   pip install telebot

   cd [path to your server]

   python start.py
